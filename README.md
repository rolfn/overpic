overpic â€“ Combine LaTeX commands over included graphics
=======================================================

The overpic environment is a combination between the LaTeX picture
environment and another LaTeX object like an image used with the
command \cmd{\includegraphics} of graphicx or a tabular. The
resulting picture environment has the same dimensions as the included
object. LaTeX commands can be placed on the object at any position;
setting a grid for the orientation is possible.
